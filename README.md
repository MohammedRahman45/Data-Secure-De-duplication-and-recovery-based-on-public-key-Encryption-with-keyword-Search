# Data-Secure-De-duplication-and-recovery-based-on-public-key-Encryption-with-keyword-Search
This project tackles the growing demand for cloud storage by implementing secure deduplication, which 
reduces storage costs by encrypting and managing duplicate data. 
 It aims to provide secure deduplication and data recovery for multiple users through public key encryption 
and hidden access matching 
 A unique scheme links each user's re-encryption key to a ciphertext chain table of stored duplicates, 
enabling efficient, secure data retrieval. 
 The project, developed in Python with libraries like Flask and Crypto.Cipher, utilizes the AES algorithm 
for robust encryption. Experimental simulations and security analysis confirm the scheme’s effectiveness
